My name is Leonardo Moreno, a software developer with extensive experience in product development, pipeline implementation, and the analysis of large genomic datasets. My technical proficiency spans a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, Java, Django, Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and C++. I am well-versed in Linux-based systems, Bash scripting, and skilled in High-Performance Computing (HPC) as well as cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud.

I am currently seeking opportunities that allow me to utilize my skills in full stack engineering, data science, or AI, particularly roles that integrate these disciplines.

I also bring additional skills including AI/ML, LLMs, Docker, Kubernetes, Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, API development, and CI/CD.
